# Doors-Auto-A-1000-New
Description:
In this repo, you can find my enhanced version of the script Auto A-1000 for Roblox doors by Geodude which he is not maintaining anymore.
I'll fix the pathfinding service and make some parts of the code more efficient and more advanced and complex.

Instructions:
I'll include a Lua file with the script for people who are directly executing I'll also include a txt file with the script for people who wanna copy and paste and a load string for mobile executors.

Background Info:
For People who don't know Geodude created a script called Auto A-1000 for the game Roblox Doors, you would execute the script in rooms and the script would auto-complete rooms for you giving you one of the hardest badges in the game A-1000 the script had the feature where your character would automatically move and complete the game your character would also auto fide from the monsters A-60 and A-120 so you don't die and delete the A-90 module so you don't have to worry about him. Sadly Geodude left the script and doesn't maintain it anymore so that is where I come in handy i will now take over and maintain this script.

Hope you like my updated version of the script and check out my profile for more advanced and awesome scripts like these and others Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
